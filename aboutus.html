        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
        <p>My name is Imani Honey, the CEO of Athlete's Circle. This safe place was created because I personally struggled with my mental health while being a student athlete.</p>
        <p>I always thought in my mind, how great it would be to know I wasn't alone in my situation. Knowing I had a friend, made me realize that I could persevere. That is why I created this safe place, so other athletes would never have to feel alone. </p>
